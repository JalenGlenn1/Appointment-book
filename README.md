# Appointment-book
- This is a program that implements an appointment book.
There are two types of events that can be recorded in an appointment book:
a personal appointment, and a meeting. Both types of events consist of a
contact (the name and telephone number of a person), and the start time of
the event.  Events always begin on the hour, and last for one hour.
An appointment book is a collection of events.
Events can be added to the appointment book, and the list of events for a
given date can be displayed.
